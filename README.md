# dotfiles
This repository contains all dotfiles that are important to me, i.e. that I don't want to lose or that I want to use across multiple machines. Feel free to use any and all of these on your own devices and to ask me if you have any questions or are experiencing difficulties with anything.
Primarily though, this repo is really just a backup for my personal convenience.
